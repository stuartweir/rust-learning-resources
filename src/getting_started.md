# Where to Start your Rust Journey

### [The Rust Programming Language (RPL) Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
This is ideal for grasping some of the core constructs of Rust, and understanding some of the main differences in the language, namely Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes, and to a lesser extent, error handling. You can also generate the book locally by running `rustup doc --book`
### [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) 
This is a by-example guide to most of the same content of the RPL Book. It was developed originally by Carol Nichols, who is one of the main authors of the RPL, designed to get you familiar with the code by learning how to fix the code in each example.
### [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) 
Helpful guide to Rust concepts at a broad overview level with, well, examples.
### [The Rust Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html)
I honestly recommend poking around through the standard library after youâ€™ve spent a bit of time in the RPL Book or other learning materials. This will hopefully give you a high level overview of what Rust itself offers you without using any crates
### [The Rust Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang)
This is where you can find the incredible Rustlang community. The #beginners channel is absolutely fantastic at helping newcomers to the language.
### [The Rust Newsletter](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)
The weekly newsletter typically has articles relevant to beginner to advanced/mature engineers
