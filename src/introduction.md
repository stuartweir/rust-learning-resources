# Why Rust Learning Resources?

The purpose for it's existence started out quite simple: I have been journeying on my path to becoming a more experienced Rust developer, and I have often found it difficult to determine what's useful to learn, when it's useful to learn it, and how to categorize my learning into categories. For example, when working on projects, what Rust crates do I use? Where can I get a deep dive on Ownership, or building a CLI tool?

How does this expand to something more useful? I'm hoping that in time, people within the Rust community contribute to this project in an effort to point _new_ Rust users in the right direction. When the Rust Programming Language Book doesn't dive deep enough, where in the Open Source Community is there a link to this topic or that? I hope this can be a centralized source for Rust knowledge to help Bootstrap the new Rust developer.
